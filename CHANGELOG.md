# Changelog

## v2.4 — 2026-04-06

Session-log enforcement based on real-world production findings.

### New features

- **Session-log gate** — `pipeline-advance.sh spec` now blocks new tasks if the previous session-log entry contains unfilled `[popuni]` placeholders. Shows which entry needs completion and lists the required fields. Forces the orchestrator to document what was done before starting new work

### Context

Production analysis of MojOff (19 pipeline tasks, 77 PASS verify-apd) revealed that 12 of 14 auto-generated session-log entries had unfilled `[popuni]` placeholders. The auto-append on pipeline reset creates skeleton entries, but without enforcement the orchestrator skips filling them in. This was the only soft rule in APD without mechanical enforcement — now it is enforced at the pipeline level.

### Edge cases verified

- Template session-log with HTML-commented examples: passes (no `[popuni]` in examples)
- Empty session-log: passes
- Missing session-log file: passes
- Properly filled entry: passes
- Entry with `[popuni]`: blocks with clear error message

## v2.3 — 2026-04-04

Security and reliability fixes based on independent framework audit.

### Bug fixes

- **CRITICAL: Pipeline reset timing** — moved pipeline reset from PreToolUse (before commit) to PostToolUse (after successful commit). Previously, if `git commit` failed after guard-git approved it (merge conflict, disk full, native pre-commit hook), the pipeline was already reset and the next commit would bypass pipeline checks. Now `pipeline-post-commit.sh` runs only after successful commit execution
- **guard-secrets coverage** — added guard-secrets.sh to `Read` and `Write|Edit` matchers in agent TEMPLATE.md. Previously, agents could `Read .env.production` or `Write` to sensitive files without being blocked (guard-secrets was only on the `Bash` matcher)

### New features

- **gh-sync.sh** — wrapper script that synchronises pipeline steps with GitHub Projects. Creates issues with spec cards, adds comments on each step, closes with commit reference or skip label. Remembers issue number across pipeline steps
- **pipeline-post-commit.sh** — PostToolUse hook that resets pipeline only after confirmed successful commit

### Updated files

- `.claude/scripts/guard-git.sh` — removed background pipeline reset (the timing bug)
- `.claude/scripts/pipeline-post-commit.sh` — new PostToolUse hook
- `.claude/scripts/gh-sync.sh` — new GitHub sync wrapper
- `.claude/settings.json` — added PostToolUse hook registration
- `.claude/agents/TEMPLATE.md` — guard-secrets on Read + Write|Edit matchers
- `.claude/skills/github-projects/SKILL.md` — gh-sync.sh documentation
- `examples/nodejs-react/` — both agents updated with new hook coverage

## v2.2 — 2026-04-04

Adds GitHub Projects integration for pipeline task tracking.

### New features

- **`/github-projects` skill** — maps APD pipeline phases to GitHub Projects v2 board columns (Spec → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done). Creates issues with spec cards, moves cards through columns, closes on commit
- **GitHub Projects section in CLAUDE.md** — configurable `{{GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}}` placeholder with pipeline tracking rules
- **`/apd-init` updated** — asks for GitHub Projects URL during setup
- **README.md** — full GitHub Projects integration docs with column mapping, labels, metrics, and Miro vs GitHub comparison table

---

## v2.1 — 2026-04-04

Adopts Claude Code v2.1.72+ features for improved agent control and observability.

### New features

- **effort frontmatter** — `high` for Builders, `max` for Reviewer/Verifier. Enforces reasoning effort at the agent level instead of relying on documentation alone
- **agent_id audit logging** — `guard-git.sh` now logs every blocked action with agent ID, type, reason, and command to `guard-audit.log`. Enables per-agent activity analysis
- **Miro channels** — `claude --channels miro` enables real-time push notifications when the board changes. Supports board change alerts, CI/CD integration, and async human gate approval

### Updated files

- `.claude/agents/TEMPLATE.md` — added `effort: {{effort}}` frontmatter field
- `.claude/scripts/guard-git.sh` — agent metadata extraction + `log_block()` on all 10 exit points
- `.claude/skills/apd-init/SKILL.md` — effort and channels guidance
- `CLAUDE.md` — Miro channels and dashboard references
- `README.md` — channels documentation in Miro integration section
- `examples/nodejs-react/` — both agents updated with `effort: high`

---

## v2.0 — 2026-04-04

Major release: from template to full-stack agentic development framework.

### New features

**Guardrails**
- Runtime write detection in `guard-bash-scope.sh` — blocks `node -e`, `python -c`, `ruby -e`, `php -r`, `perl -e` filesystem writes outside scope
- `verify-contracts.sh` — cross-layer type verification (TypeScript + C# parser) with nullable awareness, MATCH/MISMATCH/MISSING detection
- `verify-apd.sh` — 50 automated checks across 10 categories with summary table
- Self-healing session start — auto-fixes broken permissions, stale pipelines, shows merge conflict locations

**Pipeline**
- `pipeline-advance.sh metrics` — dashboard with avg/min/max duration, per-step averages, skip rate, last 5 tasks
- `pipeline-advance.sh rollback` — revert one step without full reset
- `pipeline-metrics.log` — append-only structured log for analytics
- Auto-append to session-log on pipeline reset

**Integrations**
- Figma integration — configurable design source with MCP and skill references
- Miro integration — board as source of truth for specs, architecture, planning
- `/miro-dashboard` skill — pushes pipeline status and metrics to Miro board
- Auto-detect agent scope in `/apd-init` — reads project structure and proposes agents

**Documentation**
- English README (international English) + Serbian README.sr.md with cross-links
- Mermaid architecture diagrams (pipeline flow + guardrail infrastructure)
- CQRS architecture section with agents per stack, spec card templates, contract table
- Agent examples for 7 stacks: .NET, Node.js, Java/Spring Boot, Python/Django, Python/FastAPI, Go, PHP/Symfony
- Populated example project (`examples/nodejs-react/`)

**Quality**
- Canary upgraded to self-healing (auto chmod +x, auto pipeline reset, merge conflict detection)
- `test-hooks.sh` for quick static verification
- Pipeline skip log with `stats` command and >30% threshold warning

### Breaking changes

None. Fully backwards-compatible with v1.x configurations.
