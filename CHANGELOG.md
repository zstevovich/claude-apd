# Changelog

## v3.0.0 — 2026-04-07

**Major release: APD is now an installable Claude Code plugin.**

### Breaking changes

- APD no longer works by copying `.claude/` into projects
- Install via `npx skills add zstevovich/claude-apd`, then run `/apd-init`
- Scripts live in the plugin (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`), not in the project
- Only `verify-all.sh` remains in the project (stack-specific build commands)
- Agent hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` instead of `{{PROJECT_PATH}}`

### New architecture

```
Plugin (installed once):     Project (generated per-project):
  scripts/ (15 scripts)        .claude/agents/*.md
  hooks/settings.json          .claude/rules/principles.md
  rules/workflow.md            .claude/scripts/verify-all.sh
  skills/ (4 skills)           .claude/memory/
  agents/TEMPLATE.md           .claude/.apd-config
  templates/                   .claude/.apd-version
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json   CLAUDE.md
```

### New features

- **`resolve-project.sh`** — shared library sourced by all scripts. Resolves `PROJECT_DIR` (user's project) and `APD_PLUGIN_ROOT` (plugin install) automatically
- **`/apd-upgrade` skill** — migrates v2.x copy-paste installations to v3.x plugin architecture (backup, extract config, remove old scripts, update agent hooks)
- **`.apd-config`** — project configuration file (`PROJECT_NAME`, `APD_VERSION`, `STACK`) read by session-start.sh for dynamic project name
- **`.apd-version`** — tracks installed APD version for upgrade detection
- **Per-stack verify-all templates** — `templates/verify-all/` with ready-made snippets for .NET, Node.js, Java, Python, Go, PHP
- **Per-language principles templates** — `templates/principles/` for English and Serbian
- **Plugin hooks** — `hooks/settings.json` with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths, conditional `if` fields, PostCompact, PermissionDenied

### Migration from v2.x

Run `/apd-upgrade` after installing the plugin. It will:
1. Backup your `.claude/` directory
2. Extract configuration from existing files
3. Remove scripts (now in plugin)
4. Update agent hook paths
5. Create `.apd-config` and `.apd-version`
6. Verify with `verify-apd.sh`

## v2.8 — 2026-04-07

Adopts Claude Code v2.1.85–v2.1.89 platform features. Reduces hook overhead, adds context resilience and audit coverage.

### New features

- **Conditional `if` hooks** (v2.1.85+) — guard-git fires only on `Bash(git *)`, guard-lockfile only on lock file writes, pipeline-post-commit only on `APD_ORCHESTRATOR_COMMIT=1 git commit*`. Eliminates unnecessary process spawning for every `ls`, `cat`, or non-git Bash command
- **PostCompact hook** (v2.1.76+) — re-runs `session-start.sh` after context compaction to reinject project status, pipeline state, and last session. Prevents context loss in long sessions
- **PermissionDenied hook** (v2.1.89+) — `guard-permission-denied.sh` logs denied actions with tool name and agent ID (read from stdin JSON via jq) to `guard-audit.log`. Catches what guard scripts do not cover
- **`effort` frontmatter** (v2.1.80+) — `/apd-init` runs at `effort: max`, `/miro-dashboard` and `/github-projects` at `effort: high`
- **Version check** — `session-start.sh` warns on startup if Claude Code is below v2.1.89 (recommended) or v2.1.32 (minimum functional). `verify-apd.sh` includes version as a PASS/WARN/FAIL check (54 checks total)

### Review fixes

- PermissionDenied hook changed from inline `echo` with shell env vars (always logged `unknown`/`orchestrator`) to proper script that reads `tool_name` and `agent_id` from stdin JSON
- `if` pattern on guard-git expanded to `Bash(git *) | Bash(APD_ORCHESTRATOR_COMMIT=1 git *)` to catch prefixed commands in both orchestrator and agent contexts
- `verify-apd.sh` now checks PostCompact and PermissionDenied hook registration

### Minimum Claude Code versions

| Level | Version | What works |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Minimum functional | v2.1.32 | Pipeline, guards, agents |
| Recommended | v2.1.89+ | All features including conditional hooks, PostCompact, PermissionDenied, effort |

## v2.7 — 2026-04-06

Performance optimisation based on Trivue production analysis.

### New features

- **Verifier cache** — `pipeline-advance.sh verifier` writes a timestamp to `verified.timestamp`. When `verify-all.sh` runs again during the commit hook (<120s later), it detects the fresh cache and skips the rebuild. Eliminates the double build+test that was causing ~12 min overhead on .NET + Next.js projects
- Cache is invalidated on: pipeline reset, new spec, verifier rollback

### Impact

Trivue reported Reviewer→Verifier taking 12m 39s due to double verification (Verifier agent + guard-git commit hook both running `verify-all.sh`). With cache, the commit hook completes in <1s when Verifier has already passed.

## v2.6 — 2026-04-06

- **Getting Started guide** — step-by-step walkthrough from zero to first pipeline commit in 5 minutes. macOS terminal-style examples, verify output as readable table, spec card as blockquote, quick reference table
- **Interactive demo** — animated terminal demo showing guardrails blocking and pipeline flow (GitHub Pages)
- **Demo GIF** — embedded in README for instant visual preview
- **Architecture diagrams** — "20 Patterns in 4 Layers" grid + Pipeline Flow with GitHub Projects feedback loops
- **Gitignore cleanup** — `guard-audit.log` and `pipeline-metrics.log` added as runtime files
- **Review fixes** — session-log gate regex, stat fallback, PostToolUse verification, skip log silent drop

---

## v2.5.2 — 2026-04-06

- **New architecture diagrams** — "20 Patterns in 4 Layers" grid (Memory, Pipeline, Guards, Integrations) + Pipeline Flow with GitHub Projects feedback loops. Both EN and SR README
- **Gitignore cleanup** — added `guard-audit.log` and `pipeline-metrics.log` as runtime files

---

## v2.5.1 — 2026-04-06

Patch release: 2 HIGH and 4 MEDIUM fixes from code review.

### Bug fixes

- **HIGH: Session-log gate bypassed** — v2.4 gate checked for `[fill in]` but v2.5 auto-generated entries wrote `[fill in or "None"]` which didn't match. Gate was non-functional against auto-summaries. Fixed: pattern now matches `[fill in` (any variant)
- **HIGH: Spurious pipeline reset** — empty `stat` output in self-healing evaluated as `now - 0`, producing a massive age that triggered stale pipeline reset. Fixed: validates output before arithmetic
- **MEDIUM: PostToolUse hook not verified** — `verify-apd.sh` (51 checks now) and `test-hooks.sh` now check that `pipeline-post-commit.sh` is registered
- **MEDIUM: E2E test blocked by gate** — `verify-apd.sh` pipeline test now backs up and cleans session-log before `spec` step
- **MEDIUM: Skip log silent drop** — `pipeline-advance.sh skip` now always appends even if skip-log file doesn't exist

---

## v2.5 — 2026-04-06

Dream Consolidation: auto-generated session-log summaries from pipeline context.

### New features

- **Auto-summary on pipeline reset** — `pipeline-advance.sh reset` now generates populated session-log entries from pipeline context instead of `[fill in]` skeletons. Collects: changed files from `git diff`, guard blocks from `guard-audit.log`, bottleneck detection from step timestamps. Only **New rule** remains as `[fill in]` (requires human judgement)
- **Meta-summary on session-log rotation** — `rotate-session-log.sh` now generates a one-line consolidation when archiving entries: total tasks, date range, problem count, guard block count, new rules count
- **Fixed rotation regex** — `rotate-session-log.sh` now correctly matches `## [date]` format (was missing the brackets)

### Context

Production analysis (MojOff, 19 tasks) showed 12 of 14 auto-generated entries had unfilled `[fill in]` placeholders. v2.4 added a gate that blocks new tasks until entries are filled. v2.5 eliminates most placeholders by auto-generating content from data already available in the pipeline.

### Closes

- Closes #2 — auto-generate session-log summary from pipeline context

---

## v2.4 — 2026-04-06

Session-log enforcement based on real-world production findings.

### New features

- **Session-log gate** — `pipeline-advance.sh spec` now blocks new tasks if the previous session-log entry contains unfilled `[fill in]` placeholders. Shows which entry needs completion and lists the required fields. Forces the orchestrator to document what was done before starting new work

### Context

Production analysis of MojOff (19 pipeline tasks, 77 PASS verify-apd) revealed that 12 of 14 auto-generated session-log entries had unfilled `[fill in]` placeholders. The auto-append on pipeline reset creates skeleton entries, but without enforcement the orchestrator skips filling them in. This was the only soft rule in APD without mechanical enforcement — now it is enforced at the pipeline level.

### Edge cases verified

- Template session-log with HTML-commented examples: passes (no `[fill in]` in examples)
- Empty session-log: passes
- Missing session-log file: passes
- Properly filled entry: passes
- Entry with `[fill in]`: blocks with clear error message

## v2.3 — 2026-04-04

Security and reliability fixes based on independent framework audit.

### Bug fixes

- **CRITICAL: Pipeline reset timing** — moved pipeline reset from PreToolUse (before commit) to PostToolUse (after successful commit). Previously, if `git commit` failed after guard-git approved it (merge conflict, disk full, native pre-commit hook), the pipeline was already reset and the next commit would bypass pipeline checks. Now `pipeline-post-commit.sh` runs only after successful commit execution
- **guard-secrets coverage** — added guard-secrets.sh to `Read` and `Write|Edit` matchers in agent TEMPLATE.md. Previously, agents could `Read .env.production` or `Write` to sensitive files without being blocked (guard-secrets was only on the `Bash` matcher)

### New features

- **gh-sync.sh** — wrapper script that synchronises pipeline steps with GitHub Projects. Creates issues with spec cards, adds comments on each step, closes with commit reference or skip label. Remembers issue number across pipeline steps
- **pipeline-post-commit.sh** — PostToolUse hook that resets pipeline only after confirmed successful commit

### Updated files

- `.claude/scripts/guard-git.sh` — removed background pipeline reset (the timing bug)
- `.claude/scripts/pipeline-post-commit.sh` — new PostToolUse hook
- `.claude/scripts/gh-sync.sh` — new GitHub sync wrapper
- `.claude/settings.json` — added PostToolUse hook registration
- `.claude/agents/TEMPLATE.md` — guard-secrets on Read + Write|Edit matchers
- `.claude/skills/github-projects/SKILL.md` — gh-sync.sh documentation
- `examples/nodejs-react/` — both agents updated with new hook coverage

## v2.2 — 2026-04-04

Adds GitHub Projects integration for pipeline task tracking.

### New features

- **`/github-projects` skill** — maps APD pipeline phases to GitHub Projects v2 board columns (Spec → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done). Creates issues with spec cards, moves cards through columns, closes on commit
- **GitHub Projects section in CLAUDE.md** — configurable `{{GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}}` placeholder with pipeline tracking rules
- **`/apd-init` updated** — asks for GitHub Projects URL during setup
- **README.md** — full GitHub Projects integration docs with column mapping, labels, metrics, and Miro vs GitHub comparison table

---

## v2.1 — 2026-04-04

Adopts Claude Code v2.1.72+ features for improved agent control and observability.

### New features

- **effort frontmatter** — `high` for Builders, `max` for Reviewer/Verifier. Enforces reasoning effort at the agent level instead of relying on documentation alone
- **agent_id audit logging** — `guard-git.sh` now logs every blocked action with agent ID, type, reason, and command to `guard-audit.log`. Enables per-agent activity analysis
- **Miro channels** — `claude --channels miro` enables real-time push notifications when the board changes. Supports board change alerts, CI/CD integration, and async human gate approval

### Updated files

- `.claude/agents/TEMPLATE.md` — added `effort: {{effort}}` frontmatter field
- `.claude/scripts/guard-git.sh` — agent metadata extraction + `log_block()` on all 10 exit points
- `.claude/skills/apd-init/SKILL.md` — effort and channels guidance
- `CLAUDE.md` — Miro channels and dashboard references
- `README.md` — channels documentation in Miro integration section
- `examples/nodejs-react/` — both agents updated with `effort: high`

---

## v2.0 — 2026-04-04
