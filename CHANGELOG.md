# Changelog

## v2.2 — 2026-04-04

Adds GitHub Projects integration for pipeline task tracking.

### New features

- **`/github-projects` skill** — maps APD pipeline phases to GitHub Projects v2 board columns (Spec → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done). Creates issues with spec cards, moves cards through columns, closes on commit
- **GitHub Projects section in CLAUDE.md** — configurable `{{GITHUB_PROJECT_URL}}` placeholder with pipeline tracking rules
- **`/apd-init` updated** — asks for GitHub Projects URL during setup
- **README.md** — full GitHub Projects integration docs with column mapping, labels, metrics, and Miro vs GitHub comparison table

---

## v2.1 — 2026-04-04

Adopts Claude Code v2.1.72+ features for improved agent control and observability.

### New features

- **effort frontmatter** — `high` for Builders, `max` for Reviewer/Verifier. Enforces reasoning effort at the agent level instead of relying on documentation alone
- **agent_id audit logging** — `guard-git.sh` now logs every blocked action with agent ID, type, reason, and command to `guard-audit.log`. Enables per-agent activity analysis
- **Miro channels** — `claude --channels miro` enables real-time push notifications when the board changes. Supports board change alerts, CI/CD integration, and async human gate approval

### Updated files

- `.claude/agents/TEMPLATE.md` — added `effort: {{effort}}` frontmatter field
- `.claude/scripts/guard-git.sh` — agent metadata extraction + `log_block()` on all 10 exit points
- `.claude/skills/apd-init/SKILL.md` — effort and channels guidance
- `CLAUDE.md` — Miro channels and dashboard references
- `README.md` — channels documentation in Miro integration section
- `examples/nodejs-react/` — both agents updated with `effort: high`

---

## v2.0 — 2026-04-04

Major release: from template to full-stack agentic development framework.

### New features

**Guardrails**
- Runtime write detection in `guard-bash-scope.sh` — blocks `node -e`, `python -c`, `ruby -e`, `php -r`, `perl -e` filesystem writes outside scope
- `verify-contracts.sh` — cross-layer type verification (TypeScript + C# parser) with nullable awareness, MATCH/MISMATCH/MISSING detection
- `verify-apd.sh` — 50 automated checks across 10 categories with summary table
- Self-healing session start — auto-fixes broken permissions, stale pipelines, shows merge conflict locations

**Pipeline**
- `pipeline-advance.sh metrics` — dashboard with avg/min/max duration, per-step averages, skip rate, last 5 tasks
- `pipeline-advance.sh rollback` — revert one step without full reset
- `pipeline-metrics.log` — append-only structured log for analytics
- Auto-append to session-log on pipeline reset

**Integrations**
- Figma integration — configurable design source with MCP and skill references
- Miro integration — board as source of truth for specs, architecture, planning
- `/miro-dashboard` skill — pushes pipeline status and metrics to Miro board
- Auto-detect agent scope in `/apd-init` — reads project structure and proposes agents

**Documentation**
- English README (international English) + Serbian README.sr.md with cross-links
- Mermaid architecture diagrams (pipeline flow + guardrail infrastructure)
- CQRS architecture section with agents per stack, spec card templates, contract table
- Agent examples for 7 stacks: .NET, Node.js, Java/Spring Boot, Python/Django, Python/FastAPI, Go, PHP/Symfony
- Populated example project (`examples/nodejs-react/`)

**Quality**
- Canary upgraded to self-healing (auto chmod +x, auto pipeline reset, merge conflict detection)
- `test-hooks.sh` for quick static verification
- Pipeline skip log with `stats` command and >30% threshold warning

### Breaking changes

None. Fully backwards-compatible with v1.x configurations.
